# Windows-11--custom-features
--------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
--------------------------------------------------
I have made three nice features to windows 11:
1 and 2: "copy&move to" features:
  allows to select file/s and copy to desired location, just by right clicking those files.
3: "Open in cmd" feature
  append to the context menu and option to open in cmd, in the current location.

--------------------------------------------------
Installation:
--------------------------------------------------
All you need to do is just, open those files.
After the installation in order to see the result of the scripts
reboot your PC.
